# FAQ
Here are some question I got about this package. Please don't create an new issue about a question that is already answered here.

### I get an error: `Error: Cannot find module 'express'`. How to fix?
This error happens because this package works on express, but I didn't installed on this package the express package, to make it more lightweight.

<b>To fix the issue,</b> run the following command in your terminal : `npm i express`

This should fix this issue.

### The package is not opening the server in the port I want! Why???
Well, the package can't open on every port it wants to, or you wants to.

The port is limited to the network you are using.
